      Hello! My name is Jenny. I'm a Full-Stack Developer,
      busy mom of seven, and Harry Potter enthusiast! Being a mom is my biggest joy and an incredible adventure. 
      Alongside my role as a mom, I have a passion for coding. I find immense satisfaction in bringing ideas to life through programming 
      and creating innovative solutions. Coding allows me to exercise my creativity and problem-solving skills, and it's a constant source of excitement 
      and learning for me. Whether it's building websites, developing apps, or exploring new technologies, I immerse myself in the world of coding with 
      enthusiasm. I believe that technology has the power to shape the future, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it. 
      Join me on this journey as I navigate the joys of motherhood and dive into the captivating world of coding!
